# Ray Tracer in Colab

This repo contains the C++ ray tracer forked from https://raytracing.github.io/,
a Colab notebook `Ray_Tracer.ipynb` that builds and runs the C++ ray tracer, and
some Python utils to support the notebook.

This repo is intended to be checked out to the working directory of the Colab
runtime. Please see the descriptions in the notebook.
